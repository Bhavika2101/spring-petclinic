To validate the business logic of the `getLastName` function, you would need to consider various test scenarios that focus on the behavior and constraints implied by the code and annotations. Here are some test scenarios that could be considered:

1. **Basic Retrieval Test**: 
   - Scenario: Verify that `getLastName` correctly retrieves the last name that has been set for an object instance.
   - Expected Result: The method should return the exact last name value that was previously set.

2. **Default Value Test**:
   - Scenario: Check the behavior of `getLastName` when the `lastName` field has not been explicitly set.
   - Expected Result: The method should return `null` or the default value if one has been set elsewhere in the class.

3. **Null Value Test**:
   - Scenario: Confirm how `getLastName` handles a `null` value for `lastName`, especially since the `@NotBlank` annotation is present.
   - Expected Result: The object should not allow setting `lastName` to `null` in the first place, given the `@NotBlank` constraint.

4. **Blank String Test**:
   - Scenario: Validate the behavior of `getLastName` when the `lastName` is an empty string or a string containing only whitespace, considering the `@NotBlank` annotation.
   - Expected Result: The object should not allow setting `lastName` to a blank string due to the `@NotBlank` constraint.

5. **Annotation Enforcement Test**:
   - Scenario: Ensure that the `@NotBlank` annotation is being enforced at the appropriate life cycle stage (e.g., upon persisting or updating the object in the database).
   - Expected Result: An exception should be thrown or a validation error should occur when attempting to persist or update an object with a blank `lastName`.

6. **Persistence Mapping Test**:
   - Scenario: Confirm that the `lastName` field is correctly mapped and persisted in the database, as indicated by the `@Column` annotation.
   - Expected Result: The `lastName` value should be stored in the corresponding database column without any data loss or transformation.

7. **Inheritance Mapping Test**:
   - Scenario: Since the `@MappedSuperclass` annotation is present, verify that `getLastName` works as expected when the class is extended.
   - Expected Result: Subclasses should inherit the `lastName` field properly, and `getLastName` should return the correct value for instances of subclasses.

8. **Concurrency Test**:
   - Scenario: Test the behavior of `getLastName` in a concurrent environment where multiple threads may access the same object instance.
   - Expected Result: The method should consistently return the correct `lastName`, even when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

9. **Serialization Test**:
   - Scenario: Verify that the `lastName` field is correctly serialized and deserialized, especially if the class is meant to be transmitted over a network or stored in a serialized form.
   - Expected Result: After serialization and deserialization, `getLastName` should return the same `lastName` value as before.

10. **Integration Test**:
    - Scenario: Check the integration of `getLastName` with other methods and components, especially if there are business rules that depend on the last name value.
    - Expected Result: The method should integrate smoothly with other components, and the `lastName` should be correctly used in business logic operations.

These scenarios would need to be implemented as test cases using a Java testing framework like JUnit or TestNG, and would likely involve creating instances of the class, setting the `lastName` field to various values, and asserting that `getLastName` returns the expected result under each condition.
