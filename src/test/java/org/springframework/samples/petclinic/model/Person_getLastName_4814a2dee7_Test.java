To validate the business logic of the `getLastName` function, you would need to consider various test scenarios that focus on the behavior and constraints implied by the code and annotations. Here are some test scenarios that could be considered:

1. **Basic Retrieval Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Ensure that calling `getLastName` on an instance of the class correctly returns the value of the `lastName` field.
   - **Expected Result**: The method returns the exact string stored in the `lastName` field.

2. **Null Value Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Since there are no null checks in the `getLastName` method, test what happens when `lastName` is `null`.
   - **Expected Result**: The method should return `null`.

3. **Blank Value Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Given the `@NotBlank` annotation is present on the `lastName` field, test the behavior of the getter when `lastName` is an empty string or consists solely of whitespace.
   - **Expected Result**: The method should return the blank value, but it should be noted that this scenario should be prevented at the time of setting the `lastName` value, as the `@NotBlank` annotation suggests validation will occur before persisting or updating the entity.

4. **Persistence Context Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Check if the `lastName` field is correctly mapped and persisted in the database, given the `@Column` annotation is likely present on the field.
   - **Expected Result**: The method should return the last name as it is stored in the database after a persist and flush operation.

5. **Inheritance Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Because of the `@MappedSuperclass` annotation, test if subclasses inherit the `lastName` field and the `getLastName` method behaves as expected when called on instances of subclasses.
   - **Expected Result**: The method should return the correct last name for instances of any subclass.

6. **Immutability Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Verify that the `getLastName` method does not modify the `lastName` field.
   - **Expected Result**: Multiple calls to `getLastName` should return consistent results assuming the `lastName` has not been changed by other operations.

7. **Concurrency Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Evaluate the thread-safety of the `getLastName` method when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
   - **Expected Result**: Concurrent access should not cause any inconsistency or corruption of the `lastName` value.

8. **Serialization Test**:
   - **Scenario**: If the class containing `getLastName` is serializable, test the serialization and deserialization process to ensure `lastName` is preserved.
   - **Expected Result**: Deserializing an object should result in a `lastName` that matches the value prior to serialization.

9. **Validation Test**:
   - **Scenario**: Verify that the `@NotBlank` constraint on the `lastName` field is enforced by the validation framework when the entity is being validated.
   - **Expected Result**: An instance with a blank `lastName` should fail validation and an appropriate constraint violation exception should be thrown.

10. **Integration Test**:
    - **Scenario**: Test the `getLastName` method within the context of the full application stack, including database, ORM, and business logic layers.
    - **Expected Result**: The method should seamlessly integrate with the other layers and return correct data as expected by the application's workflow.

Note that these test scenarios are designed to validate the business logic and constraints at a conceptual level. Implementing these tests would require writing actual test code, which typically involves using a testing framework like JUnit and possibly a mocking framework like Mockito to simulate the class behavior and interactions with other components.
