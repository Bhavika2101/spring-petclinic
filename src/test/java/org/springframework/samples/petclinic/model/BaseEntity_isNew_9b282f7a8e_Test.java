When creating test scenarios for the `isNew` method, we want to ensure that the method accurately reflects whether an entity is new or not based on the presence of an `id`. Here are several test scenarios that encapsulate the expected behavior of the `isNew` method:

1. **New Entity Test**: 
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass with `id` not set (i.e., `id` is `null`).
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called.
   - **Then**: The method should return `true`, indicating that the entity is new.

2. **Persisted Entity Test**:
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass with `id` set to a non-null value.
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called.
   - **Then**: The method should return `false`, indicating that the entity is not new and presumably has been persisted already.

3. **Default Constructor Test**:
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass created using the default constructor (assuming the default constructor does not set an `id`).
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called.
   - **Then**: The method should return `true`, as no `id` has been assigned yet.

4. **After Persistence Test**:
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass that has been saved to the database and thus has been assigned an `id`.
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called after the entity is persisted.
   - **Then**: The method should return `false`, as the entity now has an `id` indicating it has been stored in the database.

5. **Id Manually Set Test**:
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass where the `id` has been manually set to a non-null value.
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called.
   - **Then**: The method should return `false`, even though the entity might not have been persisted, the presence of a non-null `id` means it is not considered new.

6. **Serialization Round Trip Test**:
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass that is serialized and then deserialized back to an object (this is to ensure that the `isNew` method still works after serialization).
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called on the deserialized instance.
   - **Then**: The method should return the correct boolean value based on whether the `id` was `null` at the time of serialization.

7. **Clone/Copy Test**:
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass that has been cloned or copied (with the `id` also being cloned/copied).
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called on the cloned/copied instance.
   - **Then**: The method should return the same boolean value as the original instance's `isNew` method.

8. **Null Id After Clearing Test**:
   - **Given**: An instance of a class extending the MappedSuperclass where the `id` is initially non-null but is manually set to `null`.
   - **When**: The `isNew` method is called after the `id` has been cleared.
   - **Then**: The method should return `true`, as the entity is in a state equivalent to a new entity.

These scenarios cover a range of situations that the `isNew` method may encounter and help ensure that the method's logic is valid for the intended use cases.
