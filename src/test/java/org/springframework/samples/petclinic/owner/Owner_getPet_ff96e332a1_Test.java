To validate the business logic of the `getPet` function, consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Existing Pet by Name (Case Insensitive)**
   - Test with a pet name that exists in the collection with different cases (e.g., "Fluffy" vs. "fluffy") to ensure the method is case insensitive.

2. **Non-existing Pet by Name**
   - Test with a pet name that does not exist in the collection to ensure the method returns `null`.

3. **Null or Empty Pet Name**
   - Test the method with `null` as the name input to ensure proper handling of `null` values.
   - Test the method with an empty string to see how it handles empty input.

4. **New Pet Ignored**
   - Test with a new pet (one that is marked as new) while `ignoreNew` is set to `true` to verify that the method ignores new pets.
   - Test with a new pet (one that is marked as new) while `ignoreNew` is set to `false` to verify that the method does not ignore new pets.

5. **Pet with Null Name**
   - Add a pet with a `null` name to the collection and test to ensure that the method does not throw an exception when comparing names.

6. **Multiple Pets with Same Name**
   - Add multiple pets with the same name to the collection and test to ensure the method returns the first match.

7. **Special Characters in Pet Name**
   - Test with a pet name that contains special characters or numbers to ensure the method handles these correctly.

8. **Pet Name with Leading or Trailing Spaces**
   - Test with a pet name that has leading or trailing spaces to see if the method trims the input before comparing.

9. **Performance with Large Collection of Pets**
   - Test with a very large collection of pets to ensure the method performs well and does not have scalability issues.

10. **Concurrent Access**
    - Simulate concurrent access to the `getPet` method to ensure it behaves correctly under concurrent usage.

11. **Boundary Conditions**
    - Test with a pet name that is at the edge of allowable lengths (if there are any constraints) to ensure boundary conditions are handled properly.

12. **Integration with Persistence Layer**
    - If the `getPets()` method retrieves pets from a database or another persistence layer, test to make sure the `getPet` method integrates properly with this layer.

13. **Correctness of Returned Pet Object**
    - Verify that the returned `Pet` object is the correct instance and not just an object with the same name.

14. **Exception Handling**
    - Test to see how the method handles unexpected exceptions, such as a `NullPointerException` if the internal list of pets is `null`.

15. **Case with Only New Pets in the Collection**
    - If the collection contains only new pets, test with `ignoreNew` set to `true` to ensure that the method returns `null` for any pet name.

Remember that these test scenarios are not exhaustive and might need to be expanded based on additional context and requirements of the system in which the `getPet` method operates.
