To validate the business logic of the `initOwnerBinder` method, you would need to consider various test scenarios that ensure the method is functioning correctly and as intended. Here are some test scenarios:

1. **Disallowed Fields Test**:
   - Scenario: Ensure that the `id` field is indeed disallowed for binding.
     - Given a WebDataBinder instance with all fields allowed.
     - When the `initOwnerBinder` method is invoked.
     - Then the `id` field should be part of the disallowed fields in the WebDataBinder instance.

2. **Allowed Fields Test**:
   - Scenario: Verify that fields other than `id` are still allowed after the method execution.
     - Given a WebDataBinder instance with multiple fields including `id`.
     - When the `initOwnerBinder` method is called.
     - Then all fields except for `id` should remain allowed for binding.

3. **No Side Effects Test**:
   - Scenario: Confirm that the method does not introduce any side effects to other properties or settings of the WebDataBinder.
     - Given a WebDataBinder instance with predefined settings (e.g., custom editors, required fields, etc.).
     - When the `initOwnerBinder` method is executed.
     - Then verify that only the disallowed fields list is modified and all other settings remain unchanged.

4. **Idempotency Test**:
   - Scenario: Ensure that repeated invocations of the method do not alter the outcome.
     - Given a WebDataBinder instance where `initOwnerBinder` has already been called once.
     - When the `initOwnerBinder` method is called again.
     - Then the disallowed fields should remain consistent, and no additional fields should be disallowed.

5. **Null and Edge Case Handling**:
   - Scenario: Verify that the method handles null or edge cases gracefully.
     - Given a null WebDataBinder instance or a new instance with no fields.
     - When the `initOwnerBinder` method is invoked.
     - Then the method should not throw any exceptions and handle the scenario as expected (either by doing nothing or by correctly initializing the disallowed fields list).

6. **Reflection Test**:
   - Scenario: Confirm that the method does not allow bypassing via reflection or other means.
     - Given a WebDataBinder instance and a payload that attempts to set the `id` field through reflection or other unconventional methods.
     - When the payload is bound to a model using the WebDataBinder after the `initOwnerBinder` method is called.
     - Then the `id` field should not be set, ensuring that the disallow rule is enforced even against reflective access.

7. **Multiple Disallowed Fields Test** (If applicable):
   - Scenario: If the business logic later expands to disallow more fields, test that the new fields are also disallowed correctly.
     - Given a WebDataBinder instance with the initial set of disallowed fields.
     - When additional fields are disallowed using the `initOwnerBinder` method.
     - Then verify that all specified fields are correctly disallowed.

These test scenarios do not include writing actual test code but outline the conditions and expected outcomes for testing the `initOwnerBinder` method. Each scenario would need to be implemented in a unit test using a suitable testing framework like JUnit, along with appropriate assertions to validate the expected results.
