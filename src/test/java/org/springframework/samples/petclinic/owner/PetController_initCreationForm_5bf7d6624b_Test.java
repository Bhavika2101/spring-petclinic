Sure, here are some test scenarios you can consider:

1. **Test when the owner is null**
   - Call `initCreationForm(null, new ModelMap())`
   - Expect an exception because the owner is null.

2. **Test when the model is null**
   - Call `initCreationForm(new Owner(), null)`
   - Expect an exception because the model is null.

3. **Test when the owner is valid and the model is valid**
   - Create a mock owner and model.
   - Call `initCreationForm(mockOwner, mockModel)`
   - Verify that the pet is added to the owner's pets.
   - Verify that the pet is put into the model with the key "pet".
   - Verify that the method returns `VIEWS_PETS_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM`.

4. **Test when the owner has already a pet**
   - Create a mock owner with a pet.
   - Call `initCreationForm(mockOwner, new ModelMap())`
   - Verify that a new pet is added to the owner's pets.

5. **Test when the owner has a pet with a name**
   - Create a mock owner with a pet.
   - Call `initCreationForm(mockOwner, new ModelMap())`
   - Verify that the pet's name is not empty.

6. **Test when the owner has a pet with a birth date**
   - Create a mock owner with a pet.
   - Call `initCreationForm(mockOwner, new ModelMap())`
   - Verify that the pet's birth date is not null.

7. **Test when the owner has a pet with a type**
   - Create a mock owner with a pet.
   - Call `initCreationForm(mockOwner, new ModelMap())`
   - Verify that the pet's type is not null.

Remember, these are just test scenarios. You should also write the actual test code to validate these scenarios.
