To create test scenarios for the `initNewVisitForm` function, we need to understand the context and the purpose of this function within the application. Based on the function name and the return statement, it seems that this function is responsible for initializing a form for creating or updating a visit (likely for a pet, given the return view name). The function doesn't take any parameters and simply returns a view name as a string.

Here are some test scenarios you could consider to validate the business logic associated with this function:

1. **View Name Validation Scenario:**
   - **Given** that the `initNewVisitForm` function is called,
   - **When** the function execution is completed,
   - **Then** assert that the returned view name is `pets/createOrUpdateVisitForm`.

2. **Model Initialization Scenario:**
   - **Given** that the `initNewVisitForm` function is supposed to initialize a model for the form,
   - **When** the function is called,
   - **Then** assert that the model contains all necessary attributes for creating or updating a visit (this scenario assumes that there is a model involved even though it is not shown in the code snippet).

3. **Form Attribute Presence Scenario:**
   - **Given** that the view `pets/createOrUpdateVisitForm` requires certain form attributes to be present for proper rendering,
   - **When** the function `initNewVisitForm` is executed,
   - **Then** assert that the attributes are indeed added to the model before returning the view (this scenario would require knowledge of the view template and expected model attributes).

4. **Redirection Scenario:**
   - **Given** that the `initNewVisitForm` function is called as part of a flow (e.g., after a pet selection),
   - **When** the function is executed,
   - **Then** assert that the user is redirected to the correct view without any unexpected redirects or errors.

5. **Access Control Scenario:**
   - **Given** that the `initNewVisitForm` function should only be accessible by authenticated users with the right permissions,
   - **When** the function is accessed by an unauthorized user,
   - **Then** assert that access is denied and the user is redirected to a login page or shown an appropriate error message.

6. **Error Handling Scenario:**
   - **Given** that there could be an error in initializing the form (such as a failure to load necessary data),
   - **When** such an error occurs,
   - **Then** assert that the function handles the error gracefully, perhaps by redirecting to an error page or displaying an error message.

7. **Internationalization Scenario:**
   - **Given** that the application supports multiple languages,
   - **When** the `initNewVisitForm` function is called by a user with a non-default locale,
   - **Then** assert that the view returned is properly internationalized according to the userâ€™s locale settings.

8. **Performance Scenario:**
   - **Given** that the `initNewVisitForm` function is expected to execute within a certain time frame,
   - **When** the function is called,
   - **Then** assert that the function completes execution within the acceptable performance threshold.

These scenarios would need to be validated with appropriate test cases, which would involve setting up a testing framework, mocking necessary dependencies, and asserting expected outcomes. However, since the request was not to write any test code, these scenarios are described at a high level.
