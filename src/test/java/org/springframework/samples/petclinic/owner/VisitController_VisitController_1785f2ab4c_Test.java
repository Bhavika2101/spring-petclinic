To write test scenarios for the `VisitController` class, we will need to make some assumptions about the context of this controller since the provided code snippet does not give us the complete picture. However, we can still outline several general scenarios that would be applicable to most controller classes in a Spring MVC application.

1. **Initialization Binding Test Scenarios:**
   - Verify that the `@InitBinder` method is present and correctly sets up any necessary formatters or validators for the controller.
   - Ensure that the WebDataBinder is correctly initialized for the appropriate fields (e.g., disallowing certain fields from being bound).

2. **Get Mapping Test Scenarios:**
   - Verify that the `@GetMapping` methods are present and mapped to the correct URL patterns.
   - Test that the `@GetMapping` methods return the correct view name or response body.
   - Ensure that model attributes are correctly added to the model before returning a view.
   - Confirm that the `@PathVariable` parameters (if any) are correctly extracted and processed.

3. **Post Mapping Test Scenarios:**
   - Verify that the `@PostMapping` methods are present and mapped to the correct URL patterns.
   - Test that the `@PostMapping` methods return the correct view name or response body after a successful form submission.
   - Ensure that the `@Valid` annotation is used to trigger validation on the model attribute and that the BindingResult correctly captures validation errors.
   - Confirm that, in the case of validation errors, the controller redirects to the appropriate view with the error details.
   - Validate the business logic execution when a form is successfully submitted and all data is valid.

4. **ModelAttribute Test Scenarios:**
   - Verify that the `@ModelAttribute` methods are present and correctly create or retrieve the necessary objects for the controller's operations.
   - Test that the `@ModelAttribute` annotated methods add the correct attributes to the model.

5. **Error Handling Test Scenarios:**
   - Confirm that the controller has proper error handling for scenarios such as missing path variables, invalid data, and any custom exceptions that the controller might handle.
   - Ensure that the controller redirects to a proper error page or returns an appropriate error response when an exception is thrown.

6. **Integration Test Scenarios:**
   - Verify that the controller interacts correctly with dependencies such as the `OwnerRepository`. This may include checking that the correct methods on the repository are called and that the controller handles the results appropriately.
   - Test that the controller correctly integrates with other parts of the system, such as services, other controllers, and the database.

7. **Security Test Scenarios:**
   - If the application has security constraints, verify that the controller enforces the correct access controls for each endpoint.
   - Confirm that secured endpoints reject unauthorized access and allow access to authenticated users with the right permissions.

8. **Performance Test Scenarios:**
   - Verify that the controller's methods perform well under expected load conditions and do not introduce any performance bottlenecks.

Please note that to write more specific test scenarios, it would be necessary to have the complete controller code, including the methods within the `VisitController` class, and more information about the expected behavior and business logic.
