To write test scenarios for the `VisitController` function, we will need to make some assumptions about the context of this controller since the provided code snippet does not give us the complete picture. However, we can still outline several general scenarios.

Assuming `VisitController` manages visits to a clinic by pet owners and that there is a `Visit` model and a corresponding form to be submitted, here are some test scenarios:

1. **Initialization Binder Setup**
   - Validate that the `@InitBinder` method sets the appropriate formatters or validators on the `WebDataBinder`.

2. **Loading of Necessary Data**
   - Ensure that any required reference data for a visit form is loaded correctly (e.g., available time slots, pet types, etc.).

3. **Visit Creation Page Access**
   - Verify that the `@GetMapping` method for the visit creation page returns the correct view.
   - Check that the model contains a new `Visit` instance when accessing the visit creation page.

4. **Form Submission with Valid Data**
   - Confirm that submitting the visit creation form with valid data saves the visit and redirects to the expected page (e.g., visit confirmation or owner's visit history).

5. **Form Submission with Invalid Data**
   - Test that submitting the form with invalid data does not save the visit and returns the form view with error messages.

6. **Binding Result Errors**
   - Simulate binding errors and validate that the controller returns the form view with the appropriate error messages.

7. **Visit Update**
   - Assuming there's a method to update a visit, ensure that updating a visit with valid data persists the changes.
   - Validate that attempting to update a visit with invalid data returns the update form with errors.

8. **Handling of Path Variables**
   - Verify that the controller correctly handles valid and invalid `@PathVariable` values (e.g., owner IDs).

9. **Owner Repository Integration**
   - Check that the `OwnerRepository` is being used correctly to fetch owner details when required.
   - Ensure proper error handling if the owner does not exist in the repository when accessing visit-related pages.

10. **Validation Annotations**
    - Ensure that `@Valid` annotations trigger bean validation on the `Visit` model, and the controller appropriately responds to validation failures.

11. **Security and Permissions**
    - Confirm that only authorized users can create, view, or edit visits.
    - Test that unauthorized access to visit-related actions is properly restricted.

12. **Concurrent Access Handling**
    - Simulate concurrent submissions to test if the system correctly handles race conditions, such as double booking.

13. **Redirection and Flash Attributes**
    - Make sure that after a successful form submission, the user is redirected to the correct page, potentially with success messages passed as flash attributes.

14. **Exception Handling**
    - Test how the controller behaves under exceptional circumstances, such as database connectivity issues.

15. **Mobile and Web Browser Accessibility**
    - Verify that the visit forms and pages are accessible and render correctly across different web browsers and mobile devices.

These scenarios provide a starting point for validating the business logic of the `VisitController`. Depending on the exact responsibilities and functionalities of the controller, additional scenarios may be necessary.
