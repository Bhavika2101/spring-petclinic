To write test scenarios for the `VisitController` class, we will need to make some assumptions about the context of this controller since the provided snippet is incomplete. However, we can still outline some generic test scenarios based on the annotations and expected behavior of a typical Spring MVC controller.

1. **Initialization of WebDataBinder**:
   - Verify that the `@InitBinder` method (not shown in the snippet) initializes the `WebDataBinder` correctly, allowing for the appropriate preprocessing of request parameters or form objects.

2. **Model Population**:
   - Test that the `@ModelAttribute` method (not shown in the snippet) populates the model with necessary attributes before any `@GetMapping` or `@PostMapping` method is invoked.

3. **GET Request Handling**:
   - Scenario for a successful `@GetMapping` request: Verify that the correct view is returned when a GET request is made to a specific endpoint.
   - Scenario for an invalid path variable in `@GetMapping`: Ensure that the controller handles invalid path variables (e.g., non-existing owner ID) gracefully.

4. **POST Request Handling**:
   - Scenario for a successful `@PostMapping` request with valid data: Ensure that the controller processes the form submission correctly and redirects or returns the appropriate view.
   - Scenario for a `@PostMapping` request with validation errors: Test that the controller returns the form view with error messages when validation fails.
   - Scenario for a `@PostMapping` request with a binding error: Verify that the controller handles binding errors (e.g., type mismatches) appropriately.

5. **Validation**:
   - Test that the `@Valid` annotation is working as expected: Submit data that violates the constraints and verify that the controller catches the validation errors.

6. **OwnerRepository Interaction**:
   - Verify that the `VisitController` interacts correctly with the `OwnerRepository` (assuming this is a dependency). Mock the `OwnerRepository` and ensure that it is called appropriately to retrieve or persist data.

7. **Form Submission**:
   - Scenario for form submission with all required fields filled: Test that the controller processes the submission successfully.
   - Scenario for form submission with missing required fields: Ensure that the controller rejects the submission and provides the required feedback.

8. **Exception Handling**:
   - Verify that the controller has appropriate exception handling for any unexpected exceptions during the handling of requests.

9. **Redirection and Flows**:
   - Test that after a successful operation (e.g., creating a visit), the controller redirects to the correct page or endpoint.

10. **Security and Permissions**:
    - If applicable, test that the controller enforces the correct security constraints and that actions are only performed by users with the appropriate permissions.

Remember that these scenarios are generic and based on typical behavior of Spring MVC controllers. For more specific test scenarios, additional details about the controller's responsibilities, the business logic, and the interaction with other components would be necessary.
