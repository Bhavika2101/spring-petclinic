To validate the business logic of the `setAllowedFields` method, we can create the following test scenarios:

1. **Field Exclusion Test:**
   - Scenario: Ensure that the `id` field is indeed disallowed for binding.
   - Given: A `WebDataBinder` instance is created and the `setAllowedFields` method is called.
   - When: An attempt is made to bind a field named `id` to a model object.
   - Then: The binding result should not include the `id` field.

2. **Allowed Fields Test:**
   - Scenario: Confirm that fields other than `id` can be bound.
   - Given: A `WebDataBinder` instance with `setAllowedFields` invoked.
   - When: An attempt is made to bind fields other than `id` (e.g., `name`, `email`, etc.).
   - Then: The binding result should include all fields except `id`.

3. **Multiple Fields Exclusion Test:**
   - Scenario: Verify that only the `id` field is disallowed when multiple fields are present.
   - Given: A `WebDataBinder` instance with `setAllowedFields` called.
   - When: Multiple fields including `id` are submitted for binding.
   - Then: The binding result should exclude `id` but include all other fields.

4. **Case Sensitivity Test:**
   - Scenario: Check if the disallowed field name is case-sensitive.
   - Given: A `WebDataBinder` instance after invoking `setAllowedFields`.
   - When: An attempt is made to bind a field named `ID` or `Id` or any other case variation.
   - Then: Determine if the case variation of `id` is also disallowed or not based on the expected behavior.

5. **BindingResult Integrity Test:**
   - Scenario: Inspect the `BindingResult` for any errors related to the disallowed field.
   - Given: A `WebDataBinder` with `setAllowedFields` called and a model with a field named `id`.
   - When: Binding is performed and errors are checked in the `BindingResult`.
   - Then: There should be no errors related to the `id` field as it should not be bound.

6. **Validation Interaction Test:**
   - Scenario: Verify interaction with validation annotations when the `id` field is annotated with `@Valid`.
   - Given: A model object with `id` field annotated with `@Valid` or other validation constraints.
   - When: `setAllowedFields` is called on the `WebDataBinder`.
   - Then: Ensure that the validation for the `id` field does not occur since it is disallowed.

7. **Edge Case Test for Null and Empty Values:**
   - Scenario: Check the method's behavior when null or empty data is submitted.
   - Given: A `WebDataBinder` instance with `setAllowedFields` called.
   - When: Null or empty data is submitted for binding.
   - Then: Evaluate how the method handles null or no data scenarios.

8. **Persistence Layer Interaction Test:**
   - Scenario: Ensure that the disallowed `id` field does not affect persistence operations.
   - Given: A `WebDataBinder` with `setAllowedFields` called and a model that is to be persisted.
   - When: The model is saved to the database after binding.
   - Then: The `id` field should not be persisted or updated since it is disallowed.

9. **Web Request Binding Test:**
   - Scenario: Simulate a web request to verify that the `id` field is not bound from request parameters.
   - Given: A web request with parameters including an `id` field.
   - When: The request is processed by a controller using the `WebDataBinder`.
   - Then: The `id` field should not be present in the model after binding.

10. **Security Implication Test:**
    - Scenario: Examine potential security implications of disallowing the `id` field.
    - Given: A `WebDataBinder` with `setAllowedFields` used in a security-sensitive context.
    - When: An attempt is made to inject or manipulate the `id` field.
    - Then: The system should be secure against such manipulations due to the `id` field being disallowed.

These test scenarios cover various aspects such as functionality, security, and integration with other parts of the application. They will help ensure that the `setAllowedFields` method is working as expected and that the `id` field is properly disallowed from binding.
