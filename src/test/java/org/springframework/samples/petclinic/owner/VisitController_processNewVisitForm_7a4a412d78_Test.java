To validate the business logic of the `processNewVisitForm` method, we should consider writing test scenarios that address the various aspects of the function's expected behavior. Here are some scenarios that can be used to guide the creation of test cases:

1. **Form Validation Success Scenario:**
   - Ensure that when `result.hasErrors()` returns `false`, the visit is successfully added to the pet identified by `petId` within the owner's list of visits.
   - Verify that `owners.save(owner)` is called to persist the changes.
   - Confirm that the method returns the expected redirection string `"redirect:/owners/{ownerId}"`.

2. **Form Validation Failure Scenario:**
   - Simulate a scenario where `result.hasErrors()` returns `true`, indicating that there are validation errors in the form submission.
   - Check that no visits are added to the owner object in case of validation errors.
   - Validate that the method returns the form view `"pets/createOrUpdateVisitForm"` for correction.

3. **Owner-Pet Association:**
   - Test that the `addVisit` method correctly associates the visit with the pet specified by `petId`.
   - Check for proper handling when `petId` does not correspond to any pet belonging to the owner (e.g., pet not found or pet belongs to a different owner).

4. **Persistence Verification:**
   - Verify that the owner's information, along with the new visit, is correctly saved to the persistent storage (indicated by the call to `owners.save(owner)`).
   - Confirm that the save operation is not performed when there are form validation errors.

5. **Path Variable Handling:**
   - Check that the `@PathVariable int petId` is correctly extracted from the URL and passed to the method.
   - Verify the behavior when `petId` is not provided, is non-numeric, or is out of the valid range (negative numbers, etc.).

6. **Model Attribute Binding:**
   - Ensure that the `@ModelAttribute Owner owner` is correctly populated with data before being passed to the method.
   - Confirm that the method behaves as expected when the owner data is incomplete or invalid.

7. **Visit Object Validation:**
   - Make certain that the `@Valid Visit visit` parameter triggers bean validation and that any constraint violations are correctly captured by the `BindingResult`.

8. **Redirection Path Variables:**
   - Ensure that the redirection URL correctly incorporates the owner's ID into the path, replacing `{ownerId}` with the actual owner's ID.

9. **Exception Handling:**
   - Test the method's behavior when an unexpected exception occurs during the processing of the visit (e.g., database errors, null pointer exceptions).

10. **Security and Permissions:**
    - If applicable, verify that appropriate security checks are in place to ensure that only authorized users can add visits to pets.

Remember that these scenarios represent the high-level logic that you would want to validate. Implementing these scenarios would typically be done using a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG along with mocking frameworks such as Mockito to simulate the interactions with the `BindingResult` and `owners` repository.
