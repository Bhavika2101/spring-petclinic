To validate the business logic of the `findOwner` method, consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Owner ID is Provided and Exists:**
   - Test when a valid `ownerId` is provided, and an owner with that ID exists in the data source.
   - Expected: The method should return the correct `Owner` object that matches the given `ownerId`.

2. **Owner ID is Provided but Does Not Exist:**
   - Test when a valid `ownerId` is provided, but there is no owner with that ID in the data source.
   - Expected: The method should handle the case gracefully, possibly returning `null` or throwing an appropriate exception if the underlying `findById` method is designed to do so.

3. **Owner ID is Null:**
   - Test when `ownerId` is `null`.
   - Expected: The method should return a new `Owner` object as per the ternary operator logic in the method.

4. **Owner ID is Negative:**
   - Test when `ownerId` is a negative number, assuming negative IDs are not valid in the system.
   - Expected: The method should either return `null`, throw an exception, or handle the case as per the system's design for invalid IDs.

5. **Owner ID is Zero:**
   - Test when `ownerId` is zero, if zero is considered an invalid ID in the system.
   - Expected: Similar to the negative ID case, the method should handle this scenario appropriately.

6. **Data Source/Repository Error:**
   - Simulate a condition where the data source or repository encounters an error during the `findById` operation (e.g., database connection error).
   - Expected: The method should either propagate the exception or handle it according to the application's error-handling strategy.

7. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - Test with the boundary values of `ownerId` if there are any constraints on the ID field (e.g., maximum or minimum integer values).
   - Expected: The method should behave as expected at the boundaries of valid IDs.

8. **Concurrency:**
   - Test the method under concurrent access scenarios to ensure that it behaves correctly when multiple threads are trying to find owners simultaneously.
   - Expected: The method should be thread-safe or should not exhibit any concurrency-related issues.

9. **Type Safety:**
   - Pass an `ownerId` of a type other than `Integer` (if possible through URL manipulation or mocking) to test type safety.
   - Expected: The method should not be vulnerable to type mismatch issues and should handle or report casting errors appropriately.

10. **Performance:**
    - Measure the performance of the `findOwner` method when retrieving an owner for large data sets or under heavy load.
    - Expected: The method should perform within acceptable time limits and resource usage, as defined by the system's performance requirements.

Remember that these scenarios are intended for manual description of test cases. When implementing automated tests, you would need to write test code that sets up the test environment, mocks dependencies, and asserts the expected outcomes for each scenario.
