To validate the business logic of the `findOwner` method, consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Owner ID is Provided and Exists:**
   - Given a valid `ownerId` that exists in the `owners` repository, when the `findOwner` method is called, it should return the corresponding `Owner` object.

2. **Owner ID is Provided but Does Not Exist:**
   - Given an `ownerId` that does not exist in the `owners` repository, when the `findOwner` method is called, it should return `null` or throw an appropriate exception, depending on the behavior of `owners.findById()` when an ID is not found.

3. **Owner ID is Null:**
   - Given that `ownerId` is `null`, when the `findOwner` method is called, it should return a new `Owner` object, ensuring that it is not `null` and is a fresh instance with default values.

4. **Owner ID is Negative:**
   - Given a negative `ownerId`, when the `findOwner` method is called, it should either return `null`, throw an exception, or handle the case according to the business logic defined for such IDs.

5. **Owner ID is Zero:**
   - Given an `ownerId` of zero, when the `findOwner` method is called, verify how the method behaves, as zero may be considered an invalid ID in some systems.

6. **Owner ID is a Very Large Number:**
   - Given an exceedingly large `ownerId` that exceeds the maximum limit of the data type (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1`), when the `findOwner` method is called, it should handle the situation gracefully, possibly by throwing an exception or returning `null`.

7. **Owner ID is of Invalid Type:**
   - Given an `ownerId` of an incorrect type (e.g., a string instead of an integer), this scenario is not directly applicable to the method signature but could be tested at the controller mapping level to ensure that the application handles type mismatches appropriately.

8. **Concurrent Access:**
   - Given that multiple threads are calling `findOwner` with the same or different `ownerId` values, ensure that the method is thread-safe and behaves correctly under concurrent access.

9. **Database/Repository Access Issues:**
   - Simulate a situation where the `owners` repository is not accessible (e.g., database connection issue), and verify that the `findOwner` method handles the exception or error condition properly.

10. **Caching Behavior (if applicable):**
    - If the application employs caching, test whether the `findOwner` method retrieves the owner from the cache when available and falls back to the repository when not.

11. **Validation of Owner Object:**
    - If the returned `Owner` object has default values when created anew, ensure that these default values meet the expectations and that the object is in a valid state according to business rules.

12. **Integration with Frontend:**
    - Verify that when the `findOwner` method is integrated with the frontend and the `ownerId` is passed via URL or user input, the method behaves as expected and returns the correct `Owner` object or a new instance. This is more of an integration test scenario.

These scenarios cover a range of expected and boundary conditions that should be verified to ensure the `findOwner` method functions correctly in different situations.
