Given the provided code snippet, the `findOwner` method is designed to find an `Owner` by their `ownerId`. If the `ownerId` is not provided (i.e., it's `null`), it returns a new `Owner` object. The method appears to be part of a larger controller class that interacts with a data source (e.g., database) through an `owners` repository or service with a `findById` method.

Here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `findOwner` method:

1. **Owner ID Provided and Exists:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify that when a valid `ownerId` is provided, and it exists in the data source, the method returns the corresponding `Owner` object.
   - **Expected Result:** The returned `Owner` object's ID matches the provided `ownerId`.

2. **Owner ID Provided but Does Not Exist:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify that when a valid `ownerId` is provided, but it does not exist in the data source, the method returns `null` or throws an appropriate exception (depending on the implementation of `owners.findById`).
   - **Expected Result:** `null` is returned or an exception is thrown.

3. **Owner ID Provided is Null:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify that when the `ownerId` is `null`, the method returns a new `Owner` object.
   - **Expected Result:** A new `Owner` object is returned, and the object's ID or fields are uninitialized or set to default values.

4. **Owner ID Provided is Negative:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify that when a negative `ownerId` is provided, the method handles it appropriately (since negative IDs are typically invalid).
   - **Expected Result:** The method returns `null`, a new `Owner` object, or throws an exception, depending on the business rules.

5. **Owner ID Provided is Zero:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify that when an `ownerId` of zero is provided, the method handles it according to the business rules (zero might be considered invalid in some systems).
   - **Expected Result:** The method returns `null`, a new `Owner` object, or throws an exception, depending on how the system treats an ID of zero.

6. **Owner ID Provided is a Non-integer Value:**
   - **Scenario:** This scenario is not directly applicable to the method as written because it's strongly typed to accept an `Integer`. However, if the method is exposed via an HTTP endpoint, we should verify that non-integer values are handled gracefully by the endpoint before reaching the method.
   - **Expected Result:** The web framework should return an HTTP 400 Bad Request error or convert the value to `null`.

7. **Owner ID is the Maximum Integer Value:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify that when the `ownerId` provided is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the method can handle the input without errors.
   - **Expected Result:** The method returns the corresponding `Owner` object or `null`, depending on whether the ID exists in the data source.

8. **Simultaneous Calls with Different Owner IDs:**
   - **Scenario:** If the application is multi-threaded, verify that simultaneous calls to `findOwner` with different `ownerIds` return the correct `Owner` objects without interfering with each other.
   - **Expected Result:** Each call returns the correct `Owner` object or `null` based on the respective `ownerId`.

9. **Performance Under Load:**
   - **Scenario:** Verify the method's performance when handling a large number of requests in a short period.
   - **Expected Result:** The method maintains a reasonable response time and does not cause system degradation.

10. **Data Source Unavailable:**
    - **Scenario:** Verify the behavior of the `findOwner` method when the data source (e.g., the database) is unavailable.
    - **Expected Result:** The method should handle the failure gracefully, possibly by returning `null`, throwing a specific exception, or implementing a fallback mechanism.

Remember, the actual implementation of the `owners.findById` method and the system's handling of invalid or exceptional inputs will significantly influence the expected outcomes of these test scenarios.
