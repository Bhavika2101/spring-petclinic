To validate the business logic of the `showOwner` method, you can create the following test scenarios:

1. **Valid Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given an existing owner ID is provided.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should return a `ModelAndView` object with view name "owners/ownerDetails".
   - And the model should contain an `Owner` object with the provided ID.

2. **Non-Existent Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given a non-existent owner ID is provided.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the case appropriately (e.g., return a different view, an error message, or throw an exception).

3. **Negative Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given a negative owner ID is provided.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the case appropriately, likely similar to the non-existent owner ID scenario.

4. **Zero Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given the owner ID is zero.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the case appropriately, which might be similar to the non-existent owner ID scenario.

5. **Owner ID Data Type Mismatch Scenario:**
   - Given the owner ID provided is of an incorrect data type (e.g., a string instead of an integer).
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this value.
   - Then it should throw a type mismatch error or handle the conversion error.

6. **Database Access Error Scenario:**
   - Given a valid owner ID is provided.
   - But there is a database access issue (e.g., database is down).
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the database access error gracefully, possibly showing an error view or message.

7. **Boundary Test for Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given an owner ID at the upper limit of the integer range.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should either return the owner details or handle the situation if the ID is out of the valid range.

8. **Concurrency Scenario:**
   - Given multiple requests for the same owner ID are made concurrently.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID for each request.
   - Then it should handle concurrent access appropriately, ensuring thread safety and data consistency.

9. **Owner Object State Validation:**
   - Given a valid owner ID that corresponds to an owner with a specific state (e.g., inactive, suspended).
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should validate the state of the owner and decide if the details should be shown or if a specific message/error should be returned.

10. **Security and Authorization Scenario:**
    - Given an owner ID accessible only to certain user roles.
    - When the `showOwner` method is called by a user without the required permissions.
    - Then it should deny access and possibly return an authorization error.

11. **Input Sanitization Scenario:**
    - Given an owner ID that includes potentially malicious input (e.g., SQL injection attempt).
    - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
    - Then it should sanitize the input to prevent injection attacks and handle the input appropriately.

12. **Performance Scenario:**
    - Given a request for an owner ID under a high load.
    - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
    - Then it should perform within acceptable time limits, without causing excessive delays or timeouts.

Each of these scenarios is designed to test different aspects of the `showOwner` method's functionality and robustness. The actual tests would involve setting up the necessary preconditions, invoking the method, and then asserting the expected outcomes based on the scenario being tested.
