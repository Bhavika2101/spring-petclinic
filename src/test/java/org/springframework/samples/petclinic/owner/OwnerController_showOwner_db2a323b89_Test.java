To validate the business logic of the `showOwner` method, you can create the following test scenarios:

1. **Valid Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given an existing owner ID is provided.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should return a `ModelAndView` object with view name "owners/ownerDetails".
   - And the model should contain an `Owner` object with the provided ID.

2. **Non-Existent Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given a non-existent owner ID is provided.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the case appropriately (e.g., return a specific view with an error message or throw an EntityNotFoundException).

3. **Negative Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given a negative owner ID is provided.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the case appropriately (e.g., validation error, throwing an IllegalArgumentException).

4. **Zero Owner ID Scenario:**
   - Given the owner ID is zero.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the case appropriately (since IDs are typically positive, this might be considered invalid input).

5. **Owner ID as a Boundary Value Scenario:**
   - Given the owner ID is at the boundary of the data type (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE).
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the case appropriately without causing integer overflow or other issues.

6. **Database Access Error Scenario:**
   - Given a valid owner ID is provided.
   - But there is a database access issue (e.g., database is down).
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then it should handle the database access error gracefully and provide a meaningful response or error message to the user.

7. **ModelAndView Object Properties Scenario:**
   - Given a valid owner ID is provided.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
   - Then the returned `ModelAndView` object should have the correct view name set.
   - And the model map should contain an attribute with the exact name expected by the view (e.g., "owner").

8. **Handling of Invalid Path Variable Types Scenario:**
   - Given the path variable is of an unexpected type (e.g., a string that cannot be parsed to an integer).
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with this path variable.
   - Then it should handle the type mismatch appropriately (e.g., throwing a TypeMismatchException).

9. **Concurrency Scenario:**
   - Given multiple requests with valid owner IDs are made concurrently.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called with these IDs.
   - Then it should handle concurrent requests correctly and return the corresponding `Owner` objects without any race condition issues.

10. **Security Scenario:**
    - Given an owner ID that the current user is not authorized to view.
    - When the `showOwner` method is called with this ID.
    - Then it should enforce security constraints and prevent unauthorized access, possibly returning an access denied view or response.

These scenarios cover a range of typical test cases to ensure the `showOwner` method functions correctly under different conditions and handles edge cases and errors gracefully.
