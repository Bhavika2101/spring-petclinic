To validate the business logic of the `showOwner` method, you can create the following test scenarios:

1. **Valid Owner ID Provided:**
   - Given an existing owner ID is provided to the function.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called.
   - Then it should return a `ModelAndView` object with view name "owners/ownerDetails".
   - And the model should contain the correct `Owner` object retrieved from the `owners` repository.

2. **Non-Existent Owner ID Provided:**
   - Given a non-existent owner ID is provided to the function.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called.
   - Then it should handle the situation gracefully, either by showing a custom error message or redirecting to a standard error page.
   - And the model should not contain an `Owner` object.

3. **Negative Owner ID Provided:**
   - Given a negative owner ID is provided to the function.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called.
   - Then it should return an appropriate response indicating the invalidity of the ID (e.g., error message or redirection to an error page).

4. **Owner ID as Zero:**
   - Given the owner ID provided is zero.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called.
   - Then it should handle the case as per the business rules (some systems might consider zero as invalid, while others might have a special case for it).

5. **Owner Repository Throws Exception:**
   - Given the `findById` method of the `owners` repository throws an exception (for instance, a database connection error).
   - When the `showOwner` method is called.
   - Then it should catch the exception and handle it according to the defined error handling strategy (e.g., logging the error, showing an error page, etc.).

6. **Owner ID as a Special Character or String:**
   - This scenario is not directly applicable since the `ownerId` parameter is strongly typed as an `int`. However, if there's a possibility that the path variable can be malformed before reaching the method (e.g., through URL manipulation), we should test how the application handles such a case.

7. **Check for Correct Model Attribute Key:**
   - Given a valid owner ID.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called.
   - Then the returned `ModelAndView` object should contain the `Owner` object as a model attribute, and the key should be checked to ensure it's correct and can be accessed in the view.

8. **Check for Correct View:**
   - Given a valid owner ID.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called.
   - Then the `ModelAndView` should have the correct view name set to "owners/ownerDetails" to ensure the user is directed to the correct template.

9. **Concurrent Access:**
   - Given multiple requests with valid owner IDs are made concurrently.
   - When the `showOwner` method is called simultaneously by several threads.
   - Then it should handle all requests correctly and return the appropriate `ModelAndView` objects without mixing up the owner data between requests.

10. **Security and Permissions:**
    - Given a request is made by a user with different permission levels (e.g., admin, regular user).
    - When the `showOwner` method is called.
    - Then it should only provide access to the owner's details if the user has the necessary permissions, and otherwise, it should restrict access.

11. **Performance under Load:**
    - Given a high number of valid owner ID requests made within a short time frame.
    - When the `showOwner` method is called repeatedly.
    - Then it should maintain a reasonable response time and not degrade significantly under load.

These scenarios provide a comprehensive outline for validating the business logic of the `showOwner` method. Actual tests should be written to automate these scenarios and ensure the method behaves correctly under various conditions.
