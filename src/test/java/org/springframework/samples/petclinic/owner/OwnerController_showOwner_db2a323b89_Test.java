To validate the business logic of the `showOwner` function, you can create the following test scenarios:

1. **Valid Owner ID Scenario**
   - Given an existing owner ID is provided to the `showOwner` function.
   - When the function is called.
   - Then the function should return a `ModelAndView` object with the correct view name ("owners/ownerDetails").
   - And the model should contain an `Owner` object with the details of the specified owner.

2. **Invalid Owner ID Scenario**
   - Given an owner ID that does not exist in the database is provided to the `showOwner` function.
   - When the function is called.
   - Then the function should handle the case appropriately, either by returning a view that displays an error message or by throwing an exception that can be handled by a global exception handler.

3. **Owner ID as Negative Number Scenario**
   - Given a negative number as an owner ID to the `showOwner` function.
   - When the function is called.
   - Then the function should not find any owner and should handle the case as per the business logic defined for invalid IDs.

4. **Owner ID as Zero Scenario**
   - Given the owner ID of zero to the `showOwner` function.
   - When the function is called.
   - Then the function should handle this edge case according to the application's requirements (similar to the invalid ID scenario).

5. **Database Access Error Scenario**
   - Given a valid owner ID.
   - When the database is inaccessible or a data retrieval error occurs.
   - Then the function should handle the exception gracefully, possibly by showing an error page or logging the error for further investigation.

6. **ModelAndView Object Properties Scenario**
   - Given a valid owner ID.
   - When the function is called.
   - Then the `ModelAndView` object should not only have the correct view but also the correct data structure, ensuring that the owner details are properly passed to the view.

7. **Performance Scenario**
   - Given a valid owner ID.
   - When the function is called under load (e.g., multiple requests in a short time frame).
   - Then the function should perform within acceptable time limits and not cause any performance degradation.

8. **Security Scenario**
   - Given a valid owner ID.
   - When the function is called by a user without sufficient permissions.
   - Then the function should not disclose any owner details and should follow the application's security protocol (e.g., redirecting to a login page or displaying an authorization error).

9. **Parameter Type Mismatch Scenario**
   - Given an owner ID of an incorrect data type (e.g., a string instead of an integer).
   - When the function is called.
   - Then the application should handle the type mismatch appropriately, typically by showing a user-friendly error message or converting the input to the correct type if possible.

10. **Corner Case Scenario**
    - Given an owner ID that is on the edge of acceptable values (e.g., the highest possible integer value).
    - When the function is called.
    - Then the function should correctly handle the corner case according to the application's requirements.

11. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Scenario**
    - Given an owner ID that is an XSS attack vector (e.g., a script embedded in the ID parameter).
    - When the function is called.
    - Then the function should sanitize the input to prevent XSS attacks and ensure the application's security.

These scenarios cover various aspects that should be tested to ensure the `showOwner` function behaves as expected across different situations.
