To validate the business logic of the `showOwner` method, you could consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Valid Owner ID Provided:**
   - Given an existing owner ID, when the `showOwner` method is called, then it should return a ModelAndView instance with the view name "owners/ownerDetails".
   - The ModelAndView should have an attribute with the owner's information.

2. **Owner ID Does Not Exist:**
   - Given a non-existing owner ID, when the `showOwner` method is called, then it should handle the situation gracefully, possibly by showing a custom error message or redirecting to a generic error page.

3. **Owner ID is Negative:**
   - Given a negative owner ID, when the `showOwner` method is called, then it should either throw an appropriate exception or redirect to an error page, as negative IDs might not be valid in the business context.

4. **Owner ID is Zero:**
   - Given an owner ID of zero, when the `showOwner` method is called, then it should validate against the business rule (if IDs start from 1) and handle the scenario accordingly.

5. **Data Retrieval Failure:**
   - Simulate a scenario where the data retrieval method `owners.findById` fails (e.g., due to a database connection issue). The `showOwner` method should handle this gracefully, possibly by showing an error message or logging the exception.

6. **ModelAndView Attributes:**
   - Verify that the `ModelAndView` instance contains the correct attributes, such as the owner's details, and that they are correctly formatted and populated.

7. **Performance Under Load:**
   - Test how the `showOwner` method performs under high load conditions, ensuring that it still returns the correct results within an acceptable time frame.

8. **Security and Permissions:**
   - Verify that only authorized users can access the `showOwner` method, and that it does not expose sensitive owner information to users who should not have access to it.

9. **Path Variable Type Mismatch:**
   - Provide a non-integer value as the owner ID in the path variable and verify that the application handles this type mismatch correctly, typically by returning a 400 Bad Request response.

10. **Integration with View Layer:**
    - Ensure that the returned view "owners/ownerDetails" correctly integrates with the model and displays the owner's details as expected.

11. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection:**
    - If the owner's details contain user-generated content, verify that the view layer escapes or sanitizes this content to prevent XSS attacks.

12. **Handling of Special Characters in Path Variable:**
    - Test how the `showOwner` method handles special characters or URL-encoded values within the path variable.

13. **Redirection or Forwarding Logic:**
    - Verify if there's any redirection or forwarding logic that should be triggered after the `showOwner` method execution and whether it works as expected.

14. **Internationalization and Localization:**
    - If the application supports multiple languages, test whether the owner's details are correctly localized according to the user's preferences or settings.

15. **Accessibility Compliance:**
    - Verify that the owner's details page is accessible and complies with relevant accessibility standards, ensuring that all users can access the information.

These scenarios provide a comprehensive approach to validating the business logic of the `showOwner` method. Each scenario would require a corresponding test case to be executed during the testing phase.
