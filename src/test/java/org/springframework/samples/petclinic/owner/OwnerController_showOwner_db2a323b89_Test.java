To validate the business logic of the `showOwner` function, here are several test scenarios that should be considered:

1. **Valid Owner ID Test:**
   - Scenario: When a valid `ownerId` is provided, the function should return the details of the owner.
   - Expected Result: The `ModelAndView` object contains the correct owner details and the view name is set to "owners/ownerDetails".

2. **Invalid Owner ID Test:**
   - Scenario: When an invalid `ownerId` is provided (e.g., an ID that does not exist in the database).
   - Expected Result: The function should handle the scenario gracefully, potentially returning an error message or redirecting to a generic error page.

3. **Owner ID Boundary Test:**
   - Scenario: Test the function with boundary `ownerId` values such as the minimum and maximum integer values.
   - Expected Result: The function should handle the edge cases without throwing unexpected exceptions.

4. **Database Connection Failure Test:**
   - Scenario: Simulate a database connection failure when the `findById` method is called.
   - Expected Result: The function should handle the failure gracefully, possibly by displaying an error message or a "service unavailable" page.

5. **Owner Not Found Test:**
   - Scenario: When the `ownerId` provided does correspond to an owner that has been deleted or does not exist.
   - Expected Result: The function should return a suitable response, such as redirecting to a "not found" page or displaying a relevant error message.

6. **Null Owner ID Test:**
   - Scenario: When `null` is passed as the `ownerId`.
   - Expected Result: The function should either redirect to a default page or show an error message that the owner ID is required.

7. **Security Test:**
   - Scenario: Test if the function is exposed to any security vulnerabilities such as URL manipulation or unauthorized access.
   - Expected Result: The function should only be accessible to authorized users and should not expose sensitive data or allow for manipulation that could lead to security breaches.

8. **Performance Test:**
   - Scenario: When the function is called with a valid `ownerId` under high load conditions.
   - Expected Result: The function should perform within acceptable time limits and not cause significant performance degradation.

9. **Concurrent Access Test:**
   - Scenario: Multiple simultaneous requests are made to the function with the same or different `ownerId`.
   - Expected Result: The function should handle concurrent requests correctly, providing each request with the correct owner information without any data corruption or loss.

10. **Input Sanitization Test:**
    - Scenario: Pass in `ownerId` with potential SQL injection or scripting content.
    - Expected Result: The function should sanitize the input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

11. **Integration Test with View:**
    - Scenario: Ensure that the returned `ModelAndView` integrates correctly with the view "owners/ownerDetails" and that the data is displayed as expected.
    - Expected Result: The view should correctly represent the owner's details using the provided model.

12. **Handling of Special Characters:**
    - Scenario: Test how the function handles `ownerId` values with special characters or non-numeric input.
    - Expected Result: The function should either reject such input with a user-friendly error message or handle it according to the defined business logic.

Each of these scenarios would help in validating the business logic and ensuring that the `showOwner` function behaves correctly under various conditions.
