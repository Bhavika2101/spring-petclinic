To validate the business logic of the `showOwner` function, here are several test scenarios that should be considered:

1. **Valid Owner ID Test:**
   - Scenario: When a valid `ownerId` is provided, the function should return the details of the owner.
   - Expected Result: The `ModelAndView` object contains the correct owner details and the view name is set to "owners/ownerDetails".

2. **Invalid Owner ID Test:**
   - Scenario: When an invalid `ownerId` is provided (e.g., an ID that does not exist in the database).
   - Expected Result: The function should handle the scenario gracefully, potentially returning an error message or redirecting to a generic error page.

3. **Owner ID Boundary Test:**
   - Scenario: Test the function with boundary `ownerId` values such as the minimum and maximum integer values.
   - Expected Result: The function should handle the edge cases without throwing unexpected exceptions.

4. **Database Connection Failure Test:**
   - Scenario: Simulate a database connection failure when the `ownerId` is looked up.
   - Expected Result: The function should handle the failure gracefully, possibly by displaying a friendly error message to the user.

5. **Null Owner ID Test:**
   - Scenario: Provide a null value for `ownerId`.
   - Expected Result: The function should validate the input and handle the null case appropriately, potentially throwing a custom exception or redirecting to an error page.

6. **Security Test:**
   - Scenario: Ensure that the function does not expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to owner details.
   - Expected Result: The function should only show owner details when the user has the appropriate permissions.

7. **Performance Test:**
   - Scenario: Test the function under high load conditions with a large number of requests.
   - Expected Result: The function should perform well without significant delays or timeouts.

8. **Concurrency Test:**
   - Scenario: Multiple requests to show details for the same `ownerId` are made concurrently.
   - Expected Result: The function should handle concurrent access without any data inconsistency or application failure.

9. **Data Format Test:**
   - Scenario: Check if the owner details are correctly formatted and displayed in the view.
   - Expected Result: The owner details should be properly formatted according to the business requirements.

10. **Integration Test:**
    - Scenario: Ensure that the `showOwner` function integrates correctly with other components such as the `owners` repository and the view layer.
    - Expected Result: The function should interact seamlessly with other components and display the correct data in the view.

11. **User Experience Test:**
    - Scenario: Verify that the user experience is consistent with expectations when viewing owner details.
    - Expected Result: The page should load quickly, display all required information, and match the site's design standards.

12. **Redirect Test:**
    - Scenario: When the `ownerId` corresponds to an owner that has been deleted or is otherwise not available.
    - Expected Result: The user should be redirected to a relevant page, such as a list of owners or a not-found page.

13. **Exception Handling Test:**
    - Scenario: Force an exception to occur during the execution of the `showOwner` function (e.g., by throwing a runtime exception within the `findById` method).
    - Expected Result: The function should handle the exception and return a meaningful response or error message to the user.

Each of these test scenarios should be part of a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the `showOwner` function behaves as expected under various conditions and inputs.
