To create test scenarios for the `OwnerController`, we'd need to know more about the methods within the controller. However, since only the constructor has been provided, I'll assume some common RESTful operations that you might find in a `OwnerController` and create test scenarios based on typical CRUD operations for an `Owner` resource. If this controller has different functionalities, please provide more details.

Assuming the `OwnerController` has methods for listing owners, showing an owner's details, adding a new owner, updating an existing owner, and deleting an owner, here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic:

1. **List Owners** (`@GetMapping("/owners")`):
   - Verify that a list of owners is returned when the endpoint is accessed.
   - Verify that the correct page is returned when pagination parameters are supplied (e.g., page number and size).
   - Verify that the list is empty when there are no owners in the database.
   - Verify that a search functionality returns the correct owners based on the search criteria.

2. **Show Owner Details** (`@GetMapping("/owners/{ownerId}")`):
   - Verify that the details of the specified owner are returned when a valid owner ID is provided.
   - Verify that a 404 Not Found response is returned when an invalid owner ID is provided.
   - Verify that the correct model attributes are populated when an owner's details are shown.

3. **Add New Owner** (`@PostMapping("/owners/new")`):
   - Verify that a new owner can be added when valid data is provided.
   - Verify that validation errors are returned when invalid data is provided (e.g., missing required fields, invalid field formats).
   - Verify that upon successful creation, the user is redirected to the owner's details page or a confirmation page.
   - Verify that the owner is actually persisted in the database after the operation.

4. **Update Existing Owner** (`@PostMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/edit")`):
   - Verify that an owner's details can be updated when a valid owner ID and valid updated data are provided.
   - Verify that a 404 Not Found response is returned when an invalid owner ID is provided for update.
   - Verify that validation errors are returned when invalid data is provided for update.
   - Verify that the owner's details are actually updated in the database.

5. **Delete Owner** (`@GetMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/delete")` or `@PostMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/delete")`):
   - Verify that an owner is deleted when a valid owner ID is provided.
   - Verify that a 404 Not Found response is returned when an invalid owner ID is provided for deletion.
   - Verify that the owner is actually removed from the database.

6. **Form Initialization** (`@InitBinder`):
   - Verify that the required form data and/or initializations are performed when loading forms for add/edit operations.

7. **Model Attributes** (`@ModelAttribute`):
   - Verify that common model attributes required for views are added to the model.

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for various types of input errors or system errors.
   - Verify that the system handles unexpected exceptions gracefully, without exposing sensitive information.

9. **Security**:
   - Verify that proper authentication and authorization checks are in place for each operation.
   - Verify that owners can only perform actions on their own data unless they have elevated privileges.

These scenarios would need to be adapted to match the specific methods and logic within your `OwnerController`. Each scenario would involve setting up the test environment, executing the request against the controller, and then verifying the outcome to ensure it meets the expected results.
