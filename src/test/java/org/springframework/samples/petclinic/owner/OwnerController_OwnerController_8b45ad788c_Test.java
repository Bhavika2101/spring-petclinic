To validate the business logic of the `OwnerController` with test scenarios, we would need to know more about the methods available within the controller. However, based on the provided code snippet and common RESTful conventions, we can infer some typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and write test scenarios accordingly.

Here are potential test scenarios for the `OwnerController`:

1. **List Owners:**
   - Verify that the controller returns a list of owners when a GET request is made to the appropriate endpoint (e.g., `/owners`).
   - Verify that the list of owners is paginated if pagination parameters are passed (e.g., page number and size).
   - Verify that the correct page of owners is returned according to the pagination parameters.
   - Verify the behavior when an invalid page or size parameter is provided (e.g., non-numeric, negative).
   - Verify that the returned model contains expected attributes (e.g., list of owners, pagination information).

2. **Show Owner Details:**
   - Verify that the controller returns the details of a specific owner when a GET request is made to `/owners/{ownerId}`.
   - Verify that the correct owner details are returned for a valid owner ID.
   - Verify the behavior when an invalid owner ID is provided (e.g., non-existent ID, non-numeric).
   - Verify that the returned model contains expected attributes (e.g., owner details).

3. **Create New Owner:**
   - Verify that a new owner can be created when a POST request with valid owner data is made to `/owners/new`.
   - Verify that the controller performs validation on the provided data.
   - Verify the behavior when invalid data is submitted (e.g., missing required fields, invalid field formats).
   - Verify that the owner is persisted in the repository and that the user is redirected to the owner's details page or a confirmation page.

4. **Edit Owner Details:**
   - Verify that an owner's details can be updated when a POST request with valid data is made to `/owners/{ownerId}/edit`.
   - Verify that the controller performs validation on the provided data.
   - Verify the behavior when invalid data is submitted (e.g., missing required fields, invalid field formats).
   - Verify that the owner's details are updated in the repository and that the user is redirected to the updated owner's details page or a confirmation page.

5. **Delete Owner:**
   - Verify that an owner can be deleted when a DELETE request is made to `/owners/{ownerId}/delete` (assuming such an endpoint exists).
   - Verify the behavior when an invalid owner ID is provided.
   - Verify that the owner is removed from the repository and that the user is redirected to a confirmation page or the list of owners.

6. **Form Binding and Validation:**
   - Verify that form data is correctly bound to the Owner model during creation and editing.
   - Verify that validation annotations on the Owner model are being enforced (e.g., `@Valid`).
   - Verify the behavior when form data fails validation (e.g., binding errors are present).

7. **Search Owners:**
   - Verify that owners can be searched for using specific criteria (if such functionality exists, e.g., by last name).
   - Verify that the correct search results are returned for valid search criteria.
   - Verify the behavior when no owners match the search criteria.

8. **Data Binding Initialization:**
   - Verify that any necessary initializations for data binding (e.g., custom editors set in `@InitBinder`) work as expected.

These scenarios assume typical RESTful patterns and would require adjustment to fit the actual implementation details of the `OwnerController`. Without the full context of the controller's methods and the Owner model, these scenarios are quite general and would need to be fleshed out with more specific criteria tailored to the application's requirements and business logic.
