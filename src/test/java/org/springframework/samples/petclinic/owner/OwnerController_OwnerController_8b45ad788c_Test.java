Given the provided code snippet, it is not possible to provide comprehensive test scenarios since the actual methods within the `OwnerController` class are not shown. However, based on the imports and typical conventions in Spring MVC, we can infer some potential methods and their responsibilities that might exist in the `OwnerController`. Here are some general test scenarios that can be considered:

1. **Initialization of Web Data Binder:**
   - Given the `@InitBinder` annotation is used, verify that the correct formatters or validators are registered to the `WebDataBinder`.

2. **List Owners:**
   - Given a `@GetMapping` to list owners, verify that the controller returns a view with a list of owners.
   - Verify that pagination works correctly if a `Pageable` parameter is involved.
   - Verify that the list is correctly filtered if specific request parameters (e.g., last name) are used to filter the search.

3. **Show Owner Details:**
   - Given a `@GetMapping` with a path variable (e.g., `/owners/{ownerId}`), verify that the controller returns the details of a specific owner.
   - Verify that the controller returns the correct view if the owner exists.
   - Verify that the controller returns a 404 or a custom error page if the owner does not exist.

4. **Add New Owner:**
   - Given a `@PostMapping` to add a new owner, verify that submitting a valid owner adds the owner to the repository.
   - Verify that submitting an owner with validation errors returns to the form with the appropriate error messages.
   - Verify that after successfully adding an owner, the controller redirects to the owner's details page or another appropriate page.

5. **Update Owner Information:**
   - Given a `@PostMapping` to update an existing owner's information, verify that the controller updates the owner's information if valid data is provided.
   - Verify that validation errors are handled correctly and the user is returned to the edit form with error messages.
   - Verify that a non-existent owner ID results in an appropriate error handling scenario.

6. **Owner Deletion:**
   - If the controller supports deleting owners, verify that sending a request to delete an owner actually removes them from the repository.
   - Verify that attempting to delete a non-existent owner is handled gracefully.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Verify that the controller appropriately handles unexpected exceptions, such as database connection failures.
   - Verify that the controller provides user-friendly error messages in case of failures.

8. **Model Attributes:**
   - Verify that any `@ModelAttribute` methods add the expected attributes to the model.

9. **View Resolution:**
   - Verify that the controller returns the correct view names under various scenarios (e.g., list, details, edit, error pages).

10. **Security and Permissions:**
    - If applicable, verify that the controller enforces security constraints, such as ensuring only authorized users can add, edit, or delete owners.

Remember, these are hypothetical scenarios since the actual methods and logic are not present in the provided code snippet. To write more specific test scenarios, the actual business logic and requirements of the `OwnerController` would need to be known.
