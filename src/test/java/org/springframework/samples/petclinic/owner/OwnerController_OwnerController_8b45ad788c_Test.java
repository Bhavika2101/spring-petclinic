To create test scenarios for the `OwnerController`, we'd need to know the specific functionality that the controller provides. However, since the code snippet provided does not include the actual methods within the `OwnerController` class, I'll outline some generic test scenarios based on typical functionalities that such a controller might have. We'll assume that this controller handles CRUD operations for `Owner` entities:

1. **List Owners Scenario:**
   - Given the database has a list of owners, when the user requests the list of owners, then ensure the correct page with a list of owners is displayed.
   - When the user requests a list of owners with pagination parameters, then ensure the correct subset of owners is displayed according to the page number and page size.

2. **Show Owner Details Scenario:**
   - Given an owner with a specific ID exists, when the user requests to view this owner's details, then ensure the correct owner's information is displayed.
   - Given an owner with a specific ID does not exist, when the user requests to view this owner's details, then ensure an appropriate error message is shown or redirected to a standard error page.

3. **Create Owner Scenario:**
   - When the user submits a form with valid owner data, then ensure the owner is created in the database and the user is redirected to the owner's details page or a success confirmation page.
   - When the user submits a form with invalid owner data, then ensure validation errors are displayed and the owner is not created in the database.

4. **Edit Owner Scenario:**
   - Given an owner with a specific ID exists, when the user submits a form with updated valid data for this owner, then ensure the owner's information is updated in the database and the user is redirected to the updated owner's details page.
   - Given an owner with a specific ID does not exist, when the user tries to edit this owner, then ensure an appropriate error message is displayed or redirected to a standard error page.
   - When the user submits a form with invalid data while editing an owner, then ensure validation errors are displayed and the owner's information is not updated in the database.

5. **Delete Owner Scenario:**
   - Given an owner with a specific ID exists, when the user requests to delete this owner, then ensure the owner is deleted from the database and the user is redirected to the list of owners with a success message.
   - Given an owner with a specific ID does not exist, when the user requests to delete this owner, then ensure an appropriate error message is displayed or redirected to a standard error page.

6. **Search Owners Scenario:**
   - When the user searches for owners with specific criteria (such as name, address, etc.), then ensure the search results are displayed correctly based on the search parameters.
   - When the user searches with criteria that match no owners, then ensure a message indicating no results found is displayed.

7. **Form Binding and Validation Scenario:**
   - When the user submits a form for creating or editing an owner, ensure that form binding is correctly mapping request parameters to the model attributes.
   - Ensure that validation annotations on the Owner model are being enforced (e.g., required fields, format constraints).

8. **Error Handling Scenario:**
   - When an unexpected error occurs during any operation (e.g., database is down, network issues), then ensure that the user is presented with a friendly error message and, if appropriate, an option to retry the operation.

9. **Security Scenario:**
   - Ensure that only authorized users can create, edit, or delete owners, and unauthorized access attempts are properly handled (e.g., redirection to a login page, error message).

Please note that these are high-level scenarios and would need to be translated into actual test cases with more detailed steps, expected outcomes, and edge cases based on the real implementation and business logic of the `OwnerController`.
