As there is only a snippet of the `PetController` class provided and no specific business logic or methods are shown within the snippet, I'll outline general test scenarios based on common operations that a `PetController` might be expected to handle. These scenarios assume that the `PetController` is responsible for managing pets, which may include operations such as listing pets, viewing a single pet's details, creating, updating, and deleting pet records.

1. **Initialization of Web Data Binder:**
   - Test that the `InitBinder` properly initializes the binder with required formatters or validators.

2. **List Pets:**
   - Test that a request to the endpoint that lists all pets returns the correct view with a list of pets.
   - Test the scenario where there are no pets available and verify that the model contains an empty collection or a suitable message.
   - Test that the correct data is passed to the model, such as a collection of pets.

3. **Show Pet Details:**
   - Test that a request to view a single pet's details returns the correct view with the pet's information.
   - Test the scenario where the pet does not exist (e.g., invalid ID) and verify that it returns a suitable error message or redirects to an error page.
   - Test that the correct pet information is passed to the model when a valid pet ID is provided.

4. **Create New Pet:**
   - Test that the controller returns the correct view for the pet creation form.
   - Test submitting the pet creation form with valid data and verify that the pet is created and redirects to the appropriate view.
   - Test submitting the form with invalid data (e.g., missing required fields, invalid date format) and verify that the form returns with error messages.

5. **Update Existing Pet:**
   - Test that the controller returns the correct view for the pet update form pre-populated with the existing pet's data.
   - Test submitting the pet update form with valid changes and verify that the pet is updated and redirects to the appropriate view.
   - Test submitting the form with invalid changes and verify that the form returns with error messages.
   - Test submitting the form for a non-existent pet and verify that it handles the error gracefully.

6. **Delete Pet:**
   - Test that sending a request to delete a pet successfully removes the pet and redirects to the appropriate view.
   - Test attempting to delete a non-existent pet and verify that it handles the error gracefully.

7. **Validation:**
   - Test that the controller uses the `@Valid` annotation to validate the Pet model on create and update operations.
   - Test that the `BindingResult` is checked for errors after validation and that the controller behaves correctly if errors are present (e.g., returning to the form view with error messages).

8. **Model Attributes:**
   - Test that any model attributes required by the views are correctly added to the `ModelMap` before returning the view.

9. **Path Variables:**
   - Test that the controller correctly maps path variables (like `{petId}`) to method parameters and handles them appropriately.

10. **Error Handling:**
    - Test that the controller has proper error handling for unexpected situations, such as database errors or server issues, and returns a user-friendly error message or view.

Please note that these scenarios are quite general, and for more specific test cases, the actual methods and business logic within the `PetController` would need to be known.
