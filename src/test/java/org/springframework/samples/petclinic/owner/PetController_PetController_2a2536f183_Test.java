To validate the business logic of the `PetController` class, we would need to see the actual business logic methods within the class. The provided code snippet only includes imports and a constructor, but no methods to test against.

Assuming that there are typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other business logic methods in the `PetController` class, here are some general test scenarios that could be considered:

1. **Initialization and Data Binding:**
   - Ensure that the `@InitBinder` method properly initializes and sets allowed fields for the `WebDataBinder`.
   - Test that the data binding process correctly populates a `Pet` object from the form input.

2. **Create Pet:**
   - Verify that a new pet can be added with valid data.
   - Check that attempting to add a pet with invalid data results in the correct binding errors.
   - Confirm that adding a pet with an already existing ID or name within the same owner results in an error.
   - Ensure that a successful pet creation redirects to the correct view or endpoint.

3. **Read Pet Information:**
   - Confirm that the `PetController` can retrieve the correct pet information by ID.
   - Test that the controller handles cases where the requested pet ID does not exist.
   - Validate that the correct model attributes are added to the model before returning a view.

4. **Update Pet:**
   - Test updating a pet with valid data and ensure it saves correctly.
   - Check that updating a pet with invalid data results in the correct binding errors.
   - Verify that an attempt to update a non-existing pet ID is handled properly.

5. **Delete Pet:**
   - Confirm that a pet can be deleted given a valid ID.
   - Test that attempting to delete a pet with an invalid or non-existing ID is handled correctly.

6. **List Pets:**
   - Validate that the controller can list all pets for a given owner.
   - Check that the list is correctly populated in the model for the view.
   - Ensure that an empty list is handled gracefully if an owner has no pets.

7. **Form Display and Validation:**
   - Test that the correct form is displayed for adding or updating a pet.
   - Verify that form validation annotations (e.g., `@Valid`) are working as expected.
   - Ensure that custom validators, if any, are invoked and their error messages are displayed appropriately.

8. **Navigation and Redirection:**
   - Confirm that after performing an operation (add, update, delete), the user is redirected to the appropriate view or endpoint.
   - Test that the correct view templates are returned for each controller method.

9. **Error Handling:**
   - Check that the controller handles exceptions gracefully and displays the appropriate error messages.
   - Test that the controller returns the correct HTTP status codes for various error conditions.

10. **Security and Permissions:**
    - Ensure that only authorized users can perform certain operations (if applicable).
    - Verify that the controller respects any role-based access controls.

Without the actual methods and more context about the business logic, it's difficult to provide more specific test scenarios. However, the above scenarios should provide a good starting point for testing common functionalities of a typical `PetController` in a Spring MVC application.
