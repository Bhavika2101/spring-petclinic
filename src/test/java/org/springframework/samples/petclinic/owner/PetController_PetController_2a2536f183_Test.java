As there is only a snippet of the `PetController` class provided and not the complete class with its methods, I will outline test scenarios based on the provided snippet and typical CRUD operations that a `PetController` might handle. The test scenarios will focus on validating the business logic that might be present in such a controller.

Test Scenarios:

1. **Initialization of WebDataBinder:**
   - Verify that the `InitBinder` method properly initializes the `WebDataBinder` with the necessary formatters or validators.

2. **Retrieval of Pet Details:**
   - Scenario when a pet with a given ID exists:
     - Verify that the `GetMapping` method retrieves the correct pet details.
     - Verify that the model contains the expected attributes (e.g., pet information).
   - Scenario when a pet with a given ID does not exist:
     - Verify that the controller redirects to an error page or returns an appropriate status code.

3. **Listing of Pets:**
   - Verify that a `GetMapping` method for listing pets returns the correct view with a list of pets.
   - Verify that the model contains a collection of pets when available.
   - Verify the behavior when there are no pets to list (e.g., empty collection, message to the user, etc.).

4. **Adding a New Pet:**
   - Scenario with valid pet data:
     - Verify that the `PostMapping` method processes the pet data correctly and persists it.
     - Verify that the controller redirects to the correct view after successful pet addition.
   - Scenario with invalid pet data:
     - Verify that the controller returns validation errors.
     - Verify that the pet is not persisted and the user is informed of the errors.

5. **Editing an Existing Pet:**
   - Scenario with valid updated pet data:
     - Verify that the `PostMapping` method updates the pet information correctly.
     - Verify that the controller redirects to the correct view after successful pet update.
   - Scenario with invalid updated pet data:
     - Verify that the controller returns validation errors.
     - Verify that the changes are not persisted and the user is informed of the errors.

6. **Deleting a Pet:**
   - Scenario when a pet with a given ID exists and can be deleted:
     - Verify that the pet is successfully removed from the system.
     - Verify that the controller redirects to a confirmation page or view.
   - Scenario when a pet with a given ID does not exist or cannot be deleted:
     - Verify that the controller handles this case gracefully, possibly with an error message or status code.

7. **Validation of Pet Data:**
   - Verify that the `@Valid` annotation is used to trigger validation of the pet's data before adding or updating a pet.
   - Test the behavior when validation fails (e.g., binding errors are present).

8. **Owner Association:**
   - Verify that when adding or editing a pet, it is associated with the correct owner (assuming the `PetController` might have methods related to this).

9. **Model Attributes:**
   - Verify that the `@ModelAttribute` methods (if present) add necessary attributes to the model before rendering a view.

10. **Path Variables:**
    - Verify that `@PathVariable` annotations (if present) correctly extract parameters from the URL and are used appropriately within the controller methods.

Please note that the above scenarios are based on assumptions of typical functionality that a `PetController` might have. The actual test scenarios would need to be adapted based on the complete implementation of the `PetController` class and its methods.
