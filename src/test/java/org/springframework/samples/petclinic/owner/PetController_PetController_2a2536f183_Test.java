To validate the business logic of the `PetController` class, we would need to see the actual business logic methods within the class. The provided code snippet only includes imports and a constructor, but no methods to test.

However, assuming that there are typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other business logic methods in the `PetController` class, here are some general test scenarios that could be considered:

1. **Initialization and Data Binding:**
   - Ensure that the `@InitBinder` method properly initializes and sets up the `WebDataBinder` for the expected fields.
   - Validate that custom editors or formatters are correctly registered if they exist.

2. **Create Pet:**
   - Test that a valid pet object can be created and saved when all required fields are provided and valid.
   - Verify that an attempt to create a pet with missing or invalid fields (e.g., name, birth date, owner) results in appropriate error messages.
   - Check that creating a pet for a non-existing owner results in a proper error or exception.

3. **Read Pet Information:**
   - Confirm that the `@GetMapping` method retrieves the correct pet information given a valid pet ID.
   - Validate that an invalid or non-existing pet ID returns an appropriate error message or view.
   - Test the model population to ensure that all necessary attributes are added to the `ModelMap` before returning the view.

4. **Update Pet:**
   - Ensure that a pet's details can be updated successfully with valid data.
   - Check that attempting to update a pet with invalid data results in appropriate validation errors.
   - Verify that trying to update a non-existing pet is handled correctly.

5. **Delete Pet:**
   - Validate that a pet can be deleted when given a valid pet ID.
   - Confirm that attempting to delete a pet with a non-existing ID is handled with a suitable error response.

6. **List Pets:**
   - If there's a method to list all pets or pets by an owner, test that the correct list of pets is returned.
   - Check that the list of pets is empty when there are no pets available or the owner has no pets.

7. **Form Submission:**
   - Verify that the `@PostMapping` method for creating or updating pets handles form submissions correctly.
   - Test the behavior when a form submission has validation errors (e.g., using the `BindingResult`).

8. **Attribute Validation:**
   - Ensure that the `@ModelAttribute` methods are providing the expected attributes to the model.
   - Validate that the `@Valid` annotation is correctly triggering validation on the model attributes.

9. **View Resolution:**
   - Confirm that the correct views are returned for each controller method, especially under error conditions.

10. **Security and Permissions:**
    - If applicable, ensure that only authorized users can create, update, or delete pets.
    - Test that unauthorized access to pet data is properly restricted.

Remember that these are hypothetical scenarios since the actual methods and business logic are not provided in the snippet. Each of the above scenarios would need to be adapted to the specific logic and functionality of the `PetController` class methods.
