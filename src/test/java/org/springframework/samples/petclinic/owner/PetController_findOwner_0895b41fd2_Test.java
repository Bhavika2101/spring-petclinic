To validate the business logic of the `findOwner` method, we can define several test scenarios. These scenarios should cover various aspects of the method's functionality and any edge cases that may occur. Here are some test scenarios:

1. **Owner Exists**: 
    - Given an existing ownerId, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should return the correct Owner object.
  
2. **Owner Does Not Exist**: 
    - Given a non-existing ownerId, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message stating the owner ID was not found.

3. **Owner ID Is Negative**: 
    - Given a negative ownerId, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` since IDs are typically non-negative.

4. **Owner ID Is Zero**: 
    - Given an ownerId of zero, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should either return the Owner object associated with ID zero or throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if ID zero is not considered valid.

5. **Owner ID Is At Boundary**: 
    - Given an ownerId at the upper or lower boundary of valid IDs (for example, if IDs are limited to a certain range), when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should behave appropriately, either returning an Owner object or throwing an exception.

6. **Data Layer Failure**: 
    - Given that the data layer (the `owners.findById` method) throws an exception (e.g., database connection issue), when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should either handle the exception gracefully or let it propagate, depending on the design.

7. **Owner ID Is A Large Number**: 
    - Given a very large ownerId that is within the valid range but not likely to be present, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` stating the owner ID was not found.

8. **Owner ID Is A Special Character or String**: 
    - Given an ownerId that is not an integer (e.g., a string or special character), this scenario is invalid since the method signature only accepts an `int`. However, it's worth noting that the application should handle this case prior to calling `findOwner`.

9. **Concurrent Calls with Same Owner ID**: 
    - Given multiple concurrent calls to `findOwner` with the same valid ownerId, when the method is called, then it should return the correct Owner objects for each call without any data inconsistency.

10. **Concurrent Calls with Different Owner IDs**: 
    - Given multiple concurrent calls to `findOwner` with different ownerIds, when the method is called, then it should return the correct Owner objects for each call without affecting each other.

11. **Owner ID Is Min/Max Integer Value**: 
    - Given an ownerId that is `Integer.MIN_VALUE` or `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should either return the Owner object associated with that ID or throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if such IDs are not valid.

12. **Cache Interaction**: 
    - If there's a caching mechanism involved, given a previously fetched ownerId, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should return the Owner object, potentially from cache, ensuring that the cache is functioning as expected.

These scenarios assume that the `owners.findById` method is part of a repository or service layer that interacts with a data source to retrieve owner information. The test scenarios are designed to validate the behavior of the `findOwner` method, ensuring that it handles various situations correctly according to the business logic.
