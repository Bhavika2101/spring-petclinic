To validate the business logic of the `findOwner` function, we should consider writing test scenarios that cover the expected behavior of the function under various conditions. Here are some scenarios that can be used to guide the test code writing process:

1. **Owner ID Found**:
   - Scenario: The ownerId provided corresponds to an existing owner in the system.
   - Expected Result: The function should return the corresponding `Owner` object.

2. **Owner ID Not Found**:
   - Scenario: The ownerId provided does not match any owner in the system.
   - Expected Result: The function should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the owner ID was not found.

3. **Owner ID is Zero or Negative**:
   - Scenario: The ownerId provided is zero or a negative number.
   - Expected Result: Depending on how the system is designed to handle such cases, it should either throw an `IllegalArgumentException` or handle the case gracefully by returning null or a specific error message.

4. **Owner ID is a Very Large Number**:
   - Scenario: The ownerId provided is a very large number that exceeds the range of existing owner IDs.
   - Expected Result: The function should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` indicating that the owner ID was not found.

5. **Owner ID is Not an Integer**:
   - Scenario: The ownerId is not an integer (e.g., a string or a floating-point number is passed in a way that it bypasses URL path variable type checking).
   - Expected Result: This scenario should be handled before it reaches the `findOwner` method, typically resulting in a `TypeMismatchException` or similar. However, if such input could reach the method, it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

6. **Database/Repository Access Issues**:
   - Scenario: There is a failure in the underlying database or repository layer (e.g., a database connectivity issue).
   - Expected Result: The function should handle such exceptions gracefully, possibly rethrowing them as a more general data access exception or returning an error message or error object.

7. **Concurrent Modification**:
   - Scenario: The owner is deleted by another process after `findById` has been called but before the owner object is returned.
   - Expected Result: This is a more complex scenario that may result in an inconsistency. The function could return a stale owner object, or it might need to handle such a case by checking the owner's existence again before returning it.

8. **Owner ID is at Boundary Conditions**:
   - Scenario: The ownerId provided is at the boundary of valid IDs (e.g., the lowest or highest possible valid ID).
   - Expected Result: The function should return the corresponding `Owner` object if the ID is valid or throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if it's not.

9. **Cache or Stale Data**:
   - Scenario: The data layer uses caching, and the cache has stale data for the ownerId provided.
   - Expected Result: Depending on the caching strategy, the function should return the cached `Owner` object or refresh the cache and return the most up-to-date information.

10. **Performance Under Load**:
    - Scenario: The function is called with a valid ownerId under high load conditions.
    - Expected Result: The function should still perform adequately and return the `Owner` object within an acceptable time frame.

11. **Security and Permissions**:
    - Scenario: The function is called by a user or process that does not have the necessary permissions to access owner information.
    - Expected Result: Depending on the security requirements, the function should either throw a security exception or return some form of access denied response.

These scenarios can be adapted and expanded based on the specific requirements and context of the application the `findOwner` function is a part of. They are meant to guide the creation of unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests that ensure the function behaves correctly under a variety of conditions.
