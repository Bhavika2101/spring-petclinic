To validate the business logic of the `findOwner` method, we can define several test scenarios. These scenarios should cover various aspects of the method's functionality and any edge cases that may occur. Here are some test scenarios:

1. **Owner Exists**: 
    - Given an existing ownerId, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should return the correct Owner object.
  
2. **Owner Does Not Exist**: 
    - Given a non-existing ownerId, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message stating the owner ID was not found.

3. **Owner ID Is Negative**: 
    - Given a negative ownerId, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` since IDs are typically non-negative.

4. **Owner ID Is Zero**: 
    - Given an ownerId of zero (assuming IDs start from 1), when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` since zero may not be a valid ID.

5. **Owner ID Is At Boundary**: 
    - Given an ownerId at the upper or lower boundary of valid IDs (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE), when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should either return the Owner or throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if no owner with such ID exists.

6. **Concurrent Access**: 
    - Given that multiple threads are trying to find an owner with the same ID concurrently, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should handle concurrent access appropriately, ensuring thread safety.

7. **Database/Repository Error**: 
    - Given that there is an issue with the underlying database or repository (e.g., connection loss, timeout), when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an appropriate exception to indicate the data access problem.

8. **Invalid ID Format**: 
    - Given an ownerId in an invalid format (e.g., non-numeric where a numeric ID is expected), when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` or a relevant exception indicating the format issue.

9. **Owner ID Is Min Value**:
    - Given an ownerId of Integer.MIN_VALUE, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` since this is usually not a valid ID.

10. **Caching Behavior**: 
    - If there is a caching mechanism involved, given an ownerId that has been recently accessed, when the `findOwner` method is called again, then it should return the cached Owner object, if caching is part of the business logic.

11. **Performance Under Load**: 
    - Given a high load of requests for different ownerIds, when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should perform within acceptable response times as per the system's performance requirements.

12. **Input Sanitization**: 
    - Given ownerId input that might be malicious (e.g., SQL injection attempt), when the `findOwner` method is called, then it should sanitize the input and either throw an exception or ignore invalid characters.

Each of these scenarios would be further elaborated into detailed test cases, specifying the exact input values, the expected results, and the steps to execute the test. It's important to note that while writing the test cases, considerations should be made regarding the context of the application, the expected behavior of the `owners.findById` method, and the characteristics of the `Owner` class.
