The provided code snippet appears to be a method from a Spring MVC Controller that initializes a form for creating an `Owner` object. The method `initCreationForm` takes a `Map<String, Object>` as a parameter, creates a new `Owner` instance, puts it into the model, and returns a view name for the form page.

To validate the business logic of this method without writing test code, we can consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Initialization of the Owner Object**:
   - Verify that a new `Owner` object is created and not null.
   - Ensure that the `Owner` object is empty with default or null values for its properties (assuming that's the expected behavior).

2. **Model Attribute Presence**:
   - Check that the `model` map contains an attribute named "owner".
   - Confirm that the "owner" attribute in the model is an instance of the `Owner` class.

3. **View Name Validation**:
   - Ensure that the returned view name matches the expected string constant `VIEWS_OWNER_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM`.
   - Verify that the view name is not null or empty.

4. **Model State**:
   - Confirm that no other unexpected attributes are added to the model.
   - Validate that the model does not contain any error messages or binding results at the initialization stage.

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - Test how the method behaves if an exception occurs during the creation of the `Owner` object (this might require mocking if the `Owner` class has any logic in its constructor).
   - Ensure that the method handles any potential exceptions gracefully and that the model remains in a consistent state.

6. **Integration with View Layer**:
   - Verify that the view corresponding to `VIEWS_OWNER_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM` can be resolved by the view resolver and that it correctly displays the form based on the provided `Owner` object in the model.

7. **Concurrent Access**:
   - Test that the method is thread-safe and behaves correctly under concurrent access. This is important if the `Owner` object or any other shared resources are not supposed to be affected by concurrent modifications.

8. **Method Arguments Validation**:
   - Check how the method behaves when a null `model` argument is passed. The method should handle null arguments according to the application's error handling policy.

9. **Session Attributes** (if applicable):
   - If the `Owner` object is supposed to be stored in the session, verify that the session is updated correctly.
   - Confirm that no session attributes are overwritten unintentionally.

10. **Redirection or Forwarding** (if applicable):
    - If the method is supposed to redirect or forward to another controller or view upon certain conditions, verify that this behavior is implemented correctly.

Remember that these scenarios are for discussing what to test, and the actual implementation of the tests would require writing test code using frameworks like JUnit, Mockito, etc.
