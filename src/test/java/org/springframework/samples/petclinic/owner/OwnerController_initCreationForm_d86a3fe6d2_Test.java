To validate the business logic of the `initCreationForm` method, consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Initialization of Owner Object**: Verify that an `Owner` object is created and added to the model with the key "owner".

2. **Return Value**: Confirm that the method returns the correct view name, which should be the constant `VIEWS_OWNER_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM`.

3. **Model Map Content**: Check that no other objects aside from the `Owner` object are added to the model map, ensuring the map contains only what is necessary for the view.

4. **Model Map Integrity**: Ensure the model map is not null and that the method does not throw an exception when the model map is empty or null.

5. **Owner Object State**: Validate that the `Owner` object added to the model map is a new instance and not pre-populated with any data, as it's meant for creation.

6. **Concurrent Access**: Simulate multiple requests to the method to ensure that each call to `initCreationForm` receives a separate and independent `Owner` instance, preventing potential concurrency issues.

7. **Exception Handling**: Confirm that the method handles any exceptions that could be thrown during the execution, such as a failure in object creation or issues with adding to the model map.

8. **Model Attributes**: If there are any global model attributes that should be present in every model, such as a list of countries or states for an address, ensure that they are correctly added to the model for the form.

9. **Security Aspects**: If applicable, make sure that the method respects security constraints, such as user authentication and authorization, before allowing access to the form initialization.

10. **View Resolution**: Verify that the view resolver correctly resolves `VIEWS_OWNER_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM` to an actual view path and that the view exists in the application.

11. **Integration with Frontend**: Confirm that the frontend receives the correct model and is able to render the form properly using the provided `Owner` object.

12. **Compatibility with Binding**: If there are any formatters or validators set up for the `Owner` class, ensure that they are compatible with the new `Owner` instance provided by the method.

Remember, these are high-level scenarios and do not include implementation details of the tests. Actual test implementation would require creating test cases, possibly using a testing framework such as JUnit, and mocking the model map and other dependencies as necessary.
